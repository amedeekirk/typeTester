# typeTester
This is a rework of my CS290 (Web Development) final project. The original can be found [here](https://github.com/amedeekirk/final-project-typetest-sergio-cameron-joseph).

## About
This project originally was developed as a way for me to learn Vue and Node.JS. Since then, this application has undergone a massive rework to utilize handlebars as well as storing data in SQL in order to meet requirements for me and fellow collaborator [Kamron's](https://github.com/ebrahimk) Intro to Databases final project.
